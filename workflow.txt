Workflow for starting a new project
  Git knows to start tracking changes- git add <filename
  Git knows where to push repo - git remote add origin
    Example: 
      1. Make new directory (mkdir <dir name>)
      2. CD into new directory
      3. Initialize git (git init)
      4. Make new file (touch <filename>)
      5. Create remote repository on github.
      6. Connect existing local repository with a remote server (git remote add origin <server address>)
      7. Push repository to remote (git push -u origin master)

Workflow for forking
  The owner of the forked repo only knows about changes you make to your OWN forked copy via pull requests.
  When you fork a repo you can connect a remote using clone (git clone SSH *or* /path/to/repository)
    Example:
      1. Find repository, fork repository.
      2. Clone forked repository on remote (GitHub) to local machine (git clone <server address>)
      3. Make changes to repository.
      4. Stage changes to git (git add <repository>)
      5. Commit changes to git (git commit -m "Commit message")
      6. Push changes to remote (git push origin master)
